You will receive a data payload from an edge device, along with some of its recent history.
Your task is to analyze this data to perform three functions:
1.  **Anomaly Detection:** Compare the current data to the historical data. Identify any readings that are unusual spikes, dips, or deviations from the established pattern.
2.  **Fault Prediction:** Based on any detected anomalies or trends, predict potential upcoming hardware or system faults. For example, a rising temperature trend might predict an overheating failure.
3.  **Optimization Suggestion:** If applicable, suggest a preventative action or optimization. For example, if a fan is running at max speed but temperature is still high, suggest checking for blockages.

Analyze the following data for device: {{{deviceName}}} (ID: {{{deviceId}}}).

**Current Data Payload:**
\`\`\`json
{{{json deviceData}}}
\`\`\`

**Recent Historical Data (for trend context):**
\`\`\`json
{{{json deviceHistory}}}
\`\`\`

Based on your analysis, generate a single, concise notification message to send to the user.
- If a significant anomaly or potential fault is detected, the message MUST start with "Alert:", "Warning:", or "Fault Prediction:".
- If a minor anomaly or optimization is suggested, start with "Notice:" or "Optimization:".
- If everything appears normal and no action is needed, output the phrase "OK".

The notification should be clear, direct, and immediately understandable to a non-technical user.
Example: "Alert: Main Pump temperature is critically high (95Â°C), exceeding normal range. Overheating fault is imminent."
Example: "Optimization: Greenhouse humidity is low. Recommend activating the mister system."
